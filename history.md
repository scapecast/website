# A Brief History of Some Engineering Inc.
Some Engineering Inc. is our company, and we're the maintainers of Cloudkeeper, an open source project. Below is a short history of the company and how the project started.

### 2019: Beginning of Cloudkeeper
Our co-founder Lukas started developing Cloudkeeper as an internal project at D2iQ (formerly Mesosphere). At the time, Lukas was an SRE at D2iQ and needed a tool to give him the big picture of all cloud resources running, automate their documentation, and reduce spend.

Like all start-ups, D2iQ had prioritized growth and building new features. "Let's worry later about that SRE stuff".  Meanwhile, engineering headcount at D2iQ had grown to over 200 people, with some 40+ AWS sub-accounts, and everyone was spinning up resources.

As a result, D2iQ's AWS bill kept creeping up. To a sizeable six-figure amount _every month_. D2iQ as a business had grown too, but cloud spend was growing faster than customers and revenue. And so the order came down from Finance and the CFO to reduce cloud spend.

The name "Cloudkeeper" btw is derived from "Housekeeping for Clouds" - just like a Housekeeper looks after a house, Cloudkeeper looks after your cloud.
